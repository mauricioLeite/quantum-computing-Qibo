# Minicourse on Quantum Computing

Lectures from a three-day course on Quantum Computing, conducted by **Stefano Carrazza** (University of Milan, Italy and CERN, Switzerland) and **Matteo Robbiati** (University of Milan, Italy and CERN, Switzerland).

## Course Overview

This course aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of quantum computing, covering fundamental concepts, quantum algorithms, quantum noise, and quantum machine learning.

The lecture you contain the follow topics:
- Introducing quantum computing
- Quantum circuits, gates and shots. Bell states and ancillary qubits.
- Grover search algorithm
- Introducing quantum noise and quantum hardware limitations
- Mitigating quantum noise via Quantum Error Mitigation
- Quantum Machine Learning

## Course Materials

All the materials used in this course, including slides, notebooks, and useful scripts, can be found in the [QiboEdu repository](https://github.com/qiboteam/qiboedu).
